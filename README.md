Here's an example of a `README.md` for a GitHub repository of a Spreadsheet Manager API project written in Java with Spring Boot:

```markdown
# Spreadsheet Manager API

This project provides an API for managing spreadsheets, built using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. The API allows users to create, update, and retrieve spreadsheet data, as well as handle various spreadsheet operations like adding rows, columns, and editing cell data.

## Features

- Create and manage spreadsheets
- Add, update, and delete rows/columns in a spreadsheet
- Get spreadsheet data by ID
- Download spreadsheet in CSV format
- Error handling and validation for incorrect data
- API authentication and authorization (if enabled)

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java 11 or newer**
- **Maven** for building the project
- **Spring Boot** (this project uses Spring Boot to manage dependencies)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project running:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spreadsheet-manager-api.git
cd spreadsheet-manager-api
```

### 2. Set up the environment

Make sure to configure your environment properties. You can create an `application.properties` or `application.yml` file under `src/main/resources/` if not already provided. Typical properties might include:

```properties
# Database connection properties (if using a database)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spreadsheet_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=secretpassword

# Spring profile for development
spring.profiles.active=dev

# Server port (optional)
server.port=8080
```

### 3. Build the project

To build the project using Maven, run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will compile the code and package the application into a `.jar` file.

### 4. Run the application

To run the Spring Boot application, use the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or, if you prefer to run the packaged `.jar` file:

```bash
java -jar target/spreadsheet-manager-api-1.0.0.jar
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## API Endpoints

  "columns": 5,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00"
}
```

### 2. Get spreadsheet by ID

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/spreadsheets/{id}`

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Monthly Budget",
  "rows": 10,
  "columns": 5,
  "data": [
    ["Date", "Amount", "Category", "Description", "Status"],
    ["01/01/2025", "$500", "Rent", "January Rent", "Paid"],
    ["01/02/2025", "$200", "Utilities", "Electric Bill", "Pending"]
  ]
}
```

### 3. Add row to spreadsheet

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/spreadsheets/{id}/rows`

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "values": ["01/03/2025", "$300", "Food", "Grocery Shopping", "Paid"]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Monthly Budget",
  "rows": 11,
  "columns": 5,
  "data": [
    ["Date", "Amount", "Category", "Description", "Status"],
    ["01/01/2025", "$500", "Rent", "January Rent", "Paid"],
    ["01/02/2025", "$200", "Utilities", "Electric Bill", "Pending"],
    ["01/03/2025", "$300", "Food", "Grocery Shopping", "Paid"]
  ]
}
```

### 4. Update cell in spreadsheet

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/spreadsheets/{id}/cells`

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "row": 2,
  "column": 3,
  "value": "Utilities - Paid"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Cell updated successfully"
}
```

### 5. Download spreadsheet as CSV

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/spreadsheets/{id}/download`

**Response:** CSV file containing the spreadsheet data.

## Authentication (Optional)

If authentication is enabled (JWT or basic authentication), include the following headers in the requests:

- **Authorization:** Bearer `your-jwt-token`

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11**
- **Spring Boot** (for the web framework)
- **JPA/Hibernate** (for database interaction)
- **H2 Database** (for local development; can be replaced with MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- **Maven** (for project dependency management)
